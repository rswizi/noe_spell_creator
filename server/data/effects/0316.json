Every turn, the big hand moves forward by a quarter of the clock, sweeping through everything in its path and dealing 6 ID + P(MAG) damage. Each time the big hand completes a full cycle back to 12, the small hand advances by a quarter of the circle, triggering a powerful burst that deals 6 ID + P(MAG) damage as well.",
